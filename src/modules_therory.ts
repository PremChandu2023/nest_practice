// In Nest.js, a module is a fundamental building block that helps organize the application into cohesive units of functionality. Modules are used to group related components, such as controllers, services, and providers, together in a structured way. This architectural approach promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability of code.

// A module typically represents a specific feature or domain of the application. For example, if you are building a blog application, you might have modules for handling users, posts, comments, and authentication. Each module encapsulates all the logic related to its specific feature, making it easier to manage and understand the codebase as it grows.

//A module in Nest.js is defined using a TypeScript class and a @Module() decorator.

// imports: An array of other modules that this module depends on. This allows you to leverage functionality from other modules by making their components available within the current module.

// controllers: An array of controller classes that handle incoming requests for this module

// providers: An array of providers (services, repositories, etc.) that are used within this module. Providers are responsible for business logic and data handling.

// exports: An array of providers or other modules whose components should be accessible to other modules that import this module.

// By breaking down the application into smaller, manageable modules, Nest.js encourages a modular and scalable design, making it easier to develop, test, and maintain complex applications.
